## About This Codelab

In this codelab, you set up a project in Android Studio with the Empty Activity template and change the text message to a personalized birthday greeting.

What you'll build is an Android app that displays a birthday greeting in text format.
The codelab uses training created by **Google Developers Training team** from [Build a simple app with text composables](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-text-composables).
